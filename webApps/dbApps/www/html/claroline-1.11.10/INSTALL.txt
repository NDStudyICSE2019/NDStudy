4. ADMINISTRATION SECTION

1. REQUIREMENTS
===============

Claroline should work on the following Operating systems :

        Linux / BSD / Unix (*)
        Windows (9x, Me, NT4, 2000, XP)
        MacOs X.

  (*) Claroline have been tested on Red Hat, Debian and Ubuntu GNU/Linux
      distributions, but other UNIXes and Linux distributions should work too.
      We've received positive feedbacks from users working on Mandriva and Suse.
      
      We also heard of user managing to run Claroline on a Solaris box.
      
      Don't hesitate to notify us of any problem encountered on other
      Linux distributions or UNIX systems.

To install Claroline on a computer, whether locally or remotely,
you need the following on your machine :

1. A web server. We recommend the use Apache2, but Claroline is known to work
with IIS too and should work on any PHP-compatible web server.

2. PHP scripting language (version 5.2 or later), configured with the
   following modules : mysql, zlib, preg. Most of the PHP5 compiled
   distributions are provided with these modules. Anyway, their presence
   is checked by the Claroline install script.

   Some users could meet problems if their PHP setting doesn't fit
   these ones:

        safe_mode            = Off
        magic_quotes_runtime = Off
        short_open_tags      = Off

3. The MySQL databases server (version 5 or later) plus a login/password 
   allowing to administrate and create at least one database.

   Claroline can be installed in tow different modes : 'Single
   Database' and 'Multi Database'. In 'Multi Database' mode, Claroline
   will create a new database for each course created. This mode is
   sometimes more appropriate to manage a platform with a huge bulk of
   course sites. But it means the database account used by Claroline
   has to allow to create and administrate several databases. By
   default Claroline is set to be install on a 'single database host'
   If you want to use Claroline in 'Multi Database' mode, you have to
   select this option on purpose at install.

       WARNING ! If you use the 'single database' install option, it is
       recommended to use this database for Claroline use only. If you
       share this database with other applications, interferences could
       occurs between table names of both applications that could conducts
       to serious problems.
   
   Claroline should also work with MySQL drop in replacement alternatives like 
   MariaDB, Percona server...

4. (opt) A Mail Transport Agent (MTA). This not absolutely necessary but some
   Claroline features will remain silent if you don't provide MTA.
   Most Linux distributions provide MTA (Sendmail, Qmail, PostFix,
   ...). On Windows machines, no MTA are provided by default. You can
   either modify the php.ini file to redirect mail to an MTA available
   on an other machine, install an MTA on the Claroline server.
   Several MTA are freely available for Windows, or configure a SMTP server
   in Claroline configuration.

2. INSTALLATION PROCEDURE
=========================

2.1 NEW CLAROLINE INSTALLATION
------------------------------

1. Download 'claroline1xx.tar.gz' (UNIX, Linux) or 'claroline1xx.zip' (Windows)

2. Open a shell, go to download directory and type
   
   tar -zxvf claroline1xx.tar.gz
   
   Windows : unzip 'claroline1xx.zip' with your favorite application.
   
3. FTP or move by any means 'index.php' file and 'web' and 'claroline' 
   directories to your website on web server (whether web root or subdirectory).
   'index.php' should remain where it is, outside 'claroline' and 'web' 
   directories. You can also optionally copy the 'module' directory that 
   contains some common extension modules.
   
   UNIX and Linux : copy the claroline1xx directory to the document root
   of your web server (typically /var/www/).
   
   Windows with wampserver : drag and drop the claroline1xx
   directory to the wampserver document root folder, typically
   c:\Program Files\wamp\www\
   
   MacOSX with MAMP : drag and drop the claroline1xx
   directory to the MAMP document root folder /Applications/MAMP/htdocs/

4. The following folders need to be readable, writeable and executable
   for everyone:
   
   - claroline1xx/
   - claroline1xx/module and all its subfolders
   
   You can change the access rights from the command line under UNIX or Linux :
   chmod ugo+rwx claroline1xx/
   chmod -R ugo+rwx claroline1xx/module

4. Open Web Browser and go to

   http://www.mydomain.org/mysite/mydir/claroline/install/

   Windows : with wampserver locally, open:

   http://localhost/claroline/install/ (don't forget the final /).

   MacOSX : with MAMP locally (running on port 8888), open:

   http://localhost:8888/claroline/install/ (don't forget the final /).

5. Follow instructions.

   Windows: if you use wampserver out of the box, default connection parameters
   for MySQL are login : root and no password
   
   MacOSX : if you use MAMP, default connection parameters
   for MySQL are login : root and password : root

   Linux : use the user you have created when installing MySQL or create a user 
   for your Claroline platform

2.2 UPGRADING CLAROLINE
-----------------------

    2.2.0 IMPORTANT NOTICE : UPGRADING FROM CLAROLINE 1.10 TO CLAROLINE 1.11

When upgrading from Claroline 1.10 to Claroline 1.11 follow these instructions :

1. Download 'claroline1xx.tar.gz' (UNIX, Linux) or 'claroline1xx.zip' (Windows)

2. Open a shell, go to download directory and type

   tar -zxvf claroline1xx.tar.gz

   Windows : unzip 'claroline1xx.zip'

3. Delete your directories claroline/ and web/, and then replace them with the new 
   ones you've just extracted.  Do the same for your index.php file and the 
   .txt files.

   If you do not have a module/ directory in your old Claroline, you can copy the
   one provided in the archive. If you already have a module/ directory, you can
   copy the new CLCHAT module to this directory.


        WARNING ! Don't delete the previous directories and files before
        installing the new ones. You will loose your previous
        configuration files (eg 'claro_main.conf.php'). Simply
        replace the old directory with a new one with a 'copy'
        command. That way, the new file versions will overwrite the
        old ones and leave the others intact.
        
        Configuration files are located in /platform/conf/

4. DO NOT execute the upgrade script this could destroy some data in your database

    2.2.1 UNDERSTANDING CLAROLINE VERSION NUMBERS

Claroline version numbers are of the form 1.X.Y where X and Y are two numbers.
X is called the major version number, while Y is called the minor version number

For example : in version number 1.11.5, 11 is the major version number and 5 is
the minor version number

In other words, Claroline major versions differ by the major version number (for
example 1.4.1 and 1.10.6), while minor versions have the same major version
number but differ by the minor version number (for example 1.10.1 and 1.10.6).

This is important for the Claroline upgrade process. If you want to upgrade
Claroline between two different major version (let's say 1.9 and 1.10), you
have to follow the instructions in section 2.2.2. If you want to upgrade
Claroline between two minor versions of the same major version (let's say
1.10.1 and 1.10.6), you have to follow the instructions given in section 2.2.3.

    2.2.2 UPDGRADE FROM PREVIOUS CLAROLINE MAJOR VERSION  (ex: 1.9 to 1.10)

WARNING : if you are upgrading from 1.10 to 1.11, follow the instruction given
in section 2.2.3 instead of those below !

The upgrade works only from Claroline 1.5.x and above.
Older Claroline versions should upgrade first to Claroline 1.5.x before
upgrade to superior versions.

Before upgrading we heavily recommend you do A FULL BACKUP of the previous
Claroline directories and databases. If you are unsure how to achieve this
please ask your hosting provider for advice.

1. Download 'claroline1xx.tar.gz' (UNIX, Linux) or 'claroline1xx.zip' (Windows)

2. Open a shell, go to download directory and type

   tar -zxvf claroline1xx.tar.gz

   Windows : unzip 'claroline1xx.zip'

3. Delete your directories claroline/ and web/, and then replace them with the new 
   ones you've just extracted.  Do the same for your index.php file and the 
   .txt files.

   If you do not have a module/ directory in your old Claroline, you can copy the
   one provided in the archive. If you already have a module/ directory, you can
   copy the new CLCHAT module to this directory.


        WARNING ! Don't delete the previous directories and files before
        installing the new ones. You will loose your previous
        configuration files (eg 'claro_main.conf.php'). Simply
        replace the old directory with a new one with a 'copy'
        command. That way, the new file versions will overwrite the
        old ones and leave the others intact.
        
        Configuration files are located in /platform/conf/

4. Open a Web browser and go to

   http://www.mydomain.org/mysite/mydir/claroline/admin/upgrade/upgrade.php

   Windows with easyPhp or WampServer locally, open:

   http://localhost/mydir/claroline/admin/upgrade/upgrade.php

5. Follow instructions.

    2.3.3 UPDGRADE FROM A PREVIOUS CLAROLINE MINOR VERSION

NOTE : this is also the way to upgrade Claroline from version 1.10 to version 
1.11

Follow the following instructions to upgrade to a new minor version of the same
major version of Claroline (for example to upgrade from Claroline 1.10.1 to
1.10.6)

Before upgrading we heavily recommend you do A FULL BACKUP of the previous
Claroline directories and databases. If you are unsure how to achieve this
please ask your hosting provider for advice.

1. Download 'claroline1xx.tar.gz'

   Windows : download 'claroline1xx.zip'

2. Open a shell, go to download directory and type

   tar -zxvf claroline1xx.tar.gz

   Windows : unzip 'claroline1xx.zip'

3. Delete your directories claroline/ and web/, and then replace them with the new 
   ones you've just extracted.  Do the same for your index.php file and the 
   .txt files.
