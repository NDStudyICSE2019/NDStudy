CUSTOMIZING THE CLAROLINE PLATFORM

A. STYLESHEETS

You can customize the Claroline stylesheet by copying the contents of the 
web/css/classic folder into a subfolder in platform/css.

You can then modify the file in this subfolder to adapt the Claroline stylesheet 
to your needs.

B. LANGUAGE FILES

You can provide custom language files with custom translation of some language
variable by creating a file in platform/lang/NAMEOFLANGUAGE/complete.lang.php

For example you can add custom french translations in the file
platform/lang/french/complete.lang.php

C. TEMPLATES

You can personnalize the Claroline templates by copying the files
you want to modify from the claroline/inc/templates folder to the 
platform/templates folder and modify those copies.

If you do not follow these instructions you risk to loose
all your modifications if you upgrade your Claroline platform !
