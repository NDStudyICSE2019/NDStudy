<h3><a name="2"></a>Installation:</h3>
<p>1. Unzip the files and place them on your webserver (or locally, as you will have to make some changes and then upload) in a directory called addressbook or whatever.</p>
<p>2. Open <b>config.php</b> and change the variables to your server specification.</p>
<p>3. You need to create the table addressbook in your mySQL database. (You can alter the table name, but you need to change the entry in config.php, and the table name in addressbook.sql.) Either via telnet, or using a program such as <a href="http://www.anse.de/mysqlfront/">mySQLfront</a>, or <a href="http://phpmyadmin.sourceforge.net">phpMyAdmin</a> enter the information stored in <b>addressbook.sql</b>. You can create a separate database for the addressbook, it`s up to you.</p>

<h3>Intro:</h3>
<p>This is an address book program for people who have their own web space. At present it is does not have a multiple user function. I wrote it because I wanted a place where I could store all my addresses so I can access them from multiple locations, and its a handy backup if you lose your address book, and there weren`t any freeware programs that suited my needs. IT IS NOT SUITABLE FOR COMMERCIAL USE. If you want to use this program on an intranet, please email <b>rob@widgetmonkey.com</b> . I am working on additions, such as multiple log in. I might also expand it to become a calendar / organiser. We`ll see.</p>
<p><b>Optional extras:</b></p>
<p>You might want to password protect the addressbook - not everyone wants to have their details freely available on the web! It is HIGHLY recommended that you do. Password proctection is best done with .htaccess and .htpassword files. There are tutorials out there to help.</p>
<p>You can move the config.php file to another directory if you want to make it safer - just remember to alter the include( ) statement in dbconnect.php.</p>
