For each Ground Truth, the labelling is available in folder gs. 

gs/gs.json is the machine readable labelling. 
gs/gs.html is a user-friendly view of the labelling.


The html essentially shows all the state-pairs in the crawl. Using the navigation(Load Next, Previous) available on the top of html, you can browse through each state-pair and assign your classification. Instructions link shows the procedure followed in the study to classify a given state-pair.  (Green Mark) shows that all states have been already classified, you can review them by pressing previous. You can also disable "Auto Next" and then it will show all the pairs from the beginning.
